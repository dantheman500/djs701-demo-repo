# Daniel Stevens's Bio

My name is Daniel Stevens, and I am a student at Mississippi State University. I am a senior studying electrical engineering. I live in Columbus, Mississippi, which is only half an hour away from my school, so I travel home most weekends. I enjoy playing pickleball with my friends, fishing, and playing video games.
